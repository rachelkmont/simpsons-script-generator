The Simpsons
"TREEHOUSE OF HORROR VI"
by
John Swartzwelder
Steve Tompkins . Davids. Cohen

OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
Throughout this sequence, the . camera swoops and twists (Steadicam style) through a large haunted house, a la the
opening of HBO's "Tales from the crypt."
We open outside, where through flashes of lightning, we see
LEATHERFACE (from "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre") charge
into the house, chainsaw ROARING. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him
into:
1) THE KITCHEN, where Leatherface removes his mask to
reveal it's NED FLANDERS. He sits down at the table with
the rest of the Flanderses, dressed like the other
"Chainsaw" characters. NELSON, looking nervous with an
apple in his mouth, is the main dish. The family begins to
say grace reverently as the CAMERA MOVES INTO:
2) THE PARLOR, where the ghosts of SIDESHOW BOB and BART
circle each other, preparing to strike. Each is trying to
conceal an axe behind his back, but since they're both ·
transparent, it doesn't do much good. We MOVE INTO:
3) T ~ BATHROOM, where SMITHERS is cheerily BLOW-DRYING
his h~ir. He doesn't notice that behind him is MR. BURNS,
drowning in a glass shower completely full of water. Burns
GASPS and pounds on the glass to no avail. Smithers
finishes up and casually tosses his blow dryer into the
shower as the CAMERA SWINGS INTO:
4) THE LABORATORY, where DR. HIBBERT is experimenting on
RICHARD NIXON'S severed head, a la "Re-Animator." With
each JOLT of electricity, the head makes Nixon-y SHUDDERING
SOUNDS. The CAMERA then MOVES INTO:
5) THE BEDROOM, where a SKELETON is trying to decide on an
outfit for the day. He peruses the contents of his closet
-- SKINNER'S empty hide, MOE'S empty hide, APU'S empty
hide, and then decides on KRUSTY'S skin. As the skeleton
steps into Krusty like a jumpsuit ••.
The CAMERA MOVES through the rear window, down the
hillside, and into the Simpson house for our standard
beginning.

ACT ONE
INT. HOMER'S CAR - DAY SCENE l
Homer's car turns onto Springfield's garish business strip.
HOMER
Ah, the Miracle Mile -- where value
wears a neon sombrero and there's not a
single church or library to offend the
eye. It truly is a miracle.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD STRIP - CONTINUOUS
Homer cruises past the Paul Bunyan Vision center. On top
is a forty-foot fiberglass PAUL BUNYAN, wearing glasses.
His blue ox BABE is also wearing glasses.
HOMER
Now .1at's a great sign! I !!iill. try ox
meat.
Homer passes "Aladdin's Magic Carpets & Linoleum", which
features a giant statue of ALADDIN on a flying linoleum
floor. Then he passes a giant TAM O'SHANTER on top of "Tam
O'Shanter Tax Preparation".
HOMER (CONT'D)
(IMPRESSED) Oooh, big. (BEAT) Oooh,
big.
He suddenly spies a huge BIG BOY-LIKE CHARACTER in
checkered overalls, holding up a giant donut. The sign
says "Lard Lad Donuts: Home of the 'COLOSSAL' Donut," and
there is a banner reading "Grand Opening."
" ' \ '
3F04 FINAL l 4/21/95 Page 2.
HOMER (CONT'D)
There it is! The chain that put the
"fat" in "fat southern sheriffs!"
INT. LARD LAD DONUTS - A MINUTE LATER
Homer rushes in and slaps a dollar down on the counter.
HOMER
I want a colossal donut. Just like the
one on the sign.
The TEENAGE CLERK gives Homer a normal-sized donut. Homer
looks at it in dismay.
HOMER (CONT'D)
(ANNOYED GRUNT) Nuts!
Homer points out the window to Lard Lad's giant donut.
HOMER (CONT'D)
That's false advertising! Lard Lad
lied!
TEENAGE CLERK
Sorry, sir. No refunds.
HOMER
I paid for a colossal donut and I'm
gonna get a colossal donut.
Homer stalks toward the door. Thunder CRACKS in the
distance. outside, we see dark, Spielberg-style thunder
clouds rolling in.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD STRIP - 2:30 AM
Lightning flashes in the sky. The empty Miracle Mile is
lit up like the Las Vegas Strip. Homer, wearing pantyhose
over his head like a bank robber, drives up to Lard Lad
Donuts.
~-
3F04 FINAL 1 4/21/9~ Page 3.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
(DANCE MUSIC, THEN) We interrupt this
program for a special bulletin.
Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok
have just reported an ionic disturbance
in the vicinity of the Van Allen Belt.
Scientists are recommending that all
necessary precautions be taken.
HOMER
(SCOFFING) Eggheads. What do they
know?
Homer gets out of his car and throws a tow chain around the
giant donut.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
We now return you to Swing Serenade,
sponsored by German's Ear Guards.
(LOUD) Guard your ears (SOFT) with
German's.
Homer hits the gas and the giant donut SNAPS off. As he
speeds away, the donut BOUNCES off his roof, SHA'rI'ERS the
rear window, and then DRAGS behind the car, sparking.
HOMER
Hee hee hee. I've got your donut, Lard
Lad! And what are you gonna do about
it?
There is a flash of LIGHTNING and Lard Lad's smile turns
into a grimace of rage. His head slowly rotates to watch
Homer, a la the statues in "Jason and the Argonauts". He
.breaks free from his moorings and lumbers after Homer, but
can't catch up.
LARD LAD
(UNEARTHLY ROAR)
UP AND DOWN THE STRIP
3F04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 Page A.
In quick succession, Paul Bunyan, Aladdin, and the Tam
O'Shanter are brought to life by the unearthly roar.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 4:00 AM
The huge donut takes up the whole living room. Homer,
pantyhose rolled up to his forehead, is sitting in the
donut, happily drinking a beer. Marge SQUEEZES into the
room.
MARGE
Homer! Where did you get that?
HOMER
(GENUINE INNOCENCE) Get what?
MARGE
That giant donut.
HOMER
Well .•• I acquired it legally, you can
be sure of that.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD STRIP - SAME TIME
The giant neon Duff Cowboy comes to life, a la the "After
Midnight" beer commercial. He steps down off his perch,
proffering his giant beer to a group of excited college
students.
COLLEGE STUDENTS
Beer me, dude!/ Party on, Tex!/ Yeah,
let's party, baby! (AD LIB, ETC.)
The giant cowboy lowers the beer to the college students,
then GRINDS them into the ground with the butt of the
bottle.
COLLEGE STUDENTS (CONT'D}
(SCREAMS AND CRIES OF DISMAY)
~F04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 Page 5.
FURTHER DOWN THE STRIP
At the Zip Boys Auto Parts store, the cartoon statues of
MAURY, MEL, AND MACK come to life and step down from the
sign. After a beat, their oversized caricature heads flop
to one side. They DRAG their heads along the ground with.
their tiny bodies and GRUMBLE. The OWNER of the store runs
out.
STORE OWNER
(OLD JEWISH MAN VOICE) Fellas,
remember, whatever you do reflects on
this store! Hey, don't scratch up them
heads! What are you, crazy? You don't
drag your head in the street.
EXT. ROOFTOP OF CHANNEL 6 - EARLY MORNIHG
As the monsters rampage in the background, KENT BROCKMAN
reports.
KENT BROCKMAN
Good morning, everybody. Panic is
gripping Springfield as giant
advertising mascots rampage through the
city. Perhaps it's part of some darin~ .
new ad campaign. But what new product
could justify such carnage? ••• A
cleanser? A fat-free fudge cake that
doesn't let you down in the flavor
department like so many others--
During the above, behind Kent, the Channel 6 billboard
featuring his likeness comes to life. The GIANT KENT grabs
the real Kent.
3F04 .~HAL 1 4/21/95 Page 6.
KENT BROCKMAN (CONT'D)
Stop! Stop! Unhand me, you local
Emmy-nominated veteran news anchor!
The giant Kent Brockman climbs down the building carrying the real Kent Brockman like Faye Wray.
EXT. STREET - MORNING SCENE 2
The school bus SCREECHES to a stop in front of a giant DEVIL whose chest reads: "Red_ Devil Realty." BART and LISA
grab each other and SCREAM. The devil picks up the school
bus and peers through the front window menacingly.
CHILDREN
(SCREAMS)
OTTO
(RUBBING EYES) Whoa! Another acid
flashback! Man, I'm sure getting my
money's worth out of that little tab.
EXT. STREET - A LI'rl'LE LATER
SCREAMING people run hysterically down the street. When
they get to a red light, they stop and wait, making low
WHIMPERING sounds. Then, when the light changes, they
panic down the street again, SCREAMING even louder. A
giant PROFESSOR PEANUT (wearing pince-nez glasses and
mortarboard) CRACKS open a car like a peanut and eats the
people inside, discarding the "shell." We see a trail of
car "shells" behind him.
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET
A huge OCTOPUS MONSTER has slithered off a store and is
grabbing citizens with its tentacles and vaporizing them
with its laser eyeballs.
ANGRY CITIZEN
Why did you have to name your store
"Atomic octopus Yogurt"?!
·b
3F04 FINAL 1 4, 21/95 Page 7.
HIPPIE SHOPKEEPER
(HOSTILE) What would~ like, man?!
"Suburban Polyester Power Trip
Yogurt?!"
The hippie is immediately vaporized by the octopus.
ANGLE ON A FAMILIAR FLYING SAUCER
hovering over the scene. KANG looks out the window.
KANG
Hey, Kodos, you'll like this .••
K0D0S joins him at the window.
KANG/ K0D0S
(EVIL LAUGHTER) Foolish Earthli--
They are instantly vaporized as well.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD CITY LIMITS
Furiously HONKING cars try to flee town. We see them speed
into a tunnel, then WIDEN to see Paul Bunyan has his mouth
over the other end of the tunnel.
EXT. KWIK-E-MART
APU is frantically painting "Monster Owned" on the side of
the Kwik-E-Mart.
EXT. BIG AND TALL MEN'S SHOP - SIMULTANEOUS
A giant MAN lurches away from the shop. CHIEF WIGGUM FIRES
at him and he instantly DROPS to the ground.
CHIEF WIGGUM
Aw, they're not so tough.
LOU
Ah, Chief, that wasn't a monster. That
was the captain of the high school
basketball team.
JF04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 ~.ge 8.
CHIEF WIGGUM
(COVERING) Uh, yeah ..• Well, he was
turning into a monster, though.
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY
Bart is now riding on the shoulder of the huge red devil.
He whispers into its ear.
BART
(SLY) What are you waitin' for? Wreck
the school. You know you wanna.
The devil wrestles with his conscience. Impatient, Bart
scurries around to the devil's other shoulder and whispers
in that ear.
BART (CONT'D)
(GRUFFLY) I agree. Destroy the school.
The devil shrugs and begins destroying the school.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
There's no sign of monsters, and all is still. Homer sits
in the middle of the donut meditating in the lotus
position.
HOMER
(MANTRA) Mmmmmm. •• Mmmmmmm •••
The doorbell RINGS. Homer opens the door to reveal LARD
LAD bending over and peering in.
HOMER (CONT'D)
Hello? Yes? (REALIZING) Oh! Uh •• •
if you're looking for that big donut of
yours ••• uh •• . Flanders has it.
(POINTING, NONCHALANT) Just smash open
his house.
Lard Lad heads for Flanders' house. Homer closes the door.
3F04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 Page 9.
HOMER (CONT'D)
(AFTERTHOUGHT) He came to life. Good
for him.
We hear. a house being torn apart, then heavy footsteps
returning. The doorbell RINGS again. Homer opens the
door, and Lard Lad peers down. In the background, we see a
hysterical FLANDERS running down the street, his clothes
torn and partially missing.
FLANDERS
Help me! Help me, Lord!
He bumps smack into the towering red devil, who is just
rounding the corner.
FLANDERS (CONT'D)
(COVERING) Er ..• Lord of darkness,
that is. (BEAT) Howdilly-doo, Beelzebuddy.
ON THE SIMPSON FRONT PORCH
Homer is arguing with Lard Lad.
HOMER
I told you: Flanders has it. (IDEA) Or
Moe! (PUSHING HIM A LITTLE) Go kill
Moe.
Marge SCREECHES up in the station wagon with the kids.
MARGE
Homer! Just give him the donut. Once
he has it, that will be the end of all
this horror.
HOMER
(RELUCTANT) Well ••• okay. If it'll
end horror.
-·~~ r~n.iu.. 1 4/21/95 Page 10.
FLIP TO:·
MOMENTS LATER
Lard Lad happily holds the donut. The family looks
relieved. Suddenly, Lard Lad storms off, destroying cars
and houses with his donut, and kicking BARKING dogs over fences.
HOMER
Don't you ever get tired of being wrong
all the time?
MARGE
(MEEKLY) Sometimes.
WIDE SHOT OF THE CITY
Amidst the destruction, the monsters are making Godzillastyle SCREAMING noises and lumbering about awkwardly,
except for Professor Peanut, who strolls gracefully across
town at normal speed, twirling his cane jauntily. A giant
top-hatted exterminator with a mallet behind his back (a la
the Western Exterminator logo) FLATTENS a passing trolley. ALADDIN flies past on his linoleum floor, the Tam O'Shanter
slithers by like the blob, then the Zip Boys struggle by,
pushing their over-sized heads in shopping carts.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - FRONT YARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Marge, Bart, and Lisa watch Lard Lad lumber off into the
distance.
MARGE
These monsters are destroying
everything and everyone we hold dear!
(THEN) And you kids should have
jackets on.
Lisa notices one of Lard Lad's footprints and walks over.
LISA
Hey, what's that in his footprint?
JF04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 Page 11.
She sees the imprint of a copyright notice in Lard Lad's
footprint. The copyright reads "(c) 1947, VAN BRUNT &
CHURCHILL ADVERTISING."
LISA
Hm. Maybe they'll know something.
SCENE 3
EXT. VAN BRUNT & CHURCHILL AD AGENCY - A LITTLE LATER
Lisa's bike is parked outside.
LISA (V .O.)
So you created all those giant
characters?
INT. AD AGENCY - CONTINUOUS
MR. VAN BRUNT
(MASON ADAMS-TYPE VOICE) Mmm-hmm. All
except for the atomic octopus.
(BITTER) Sure, it won lots of awards,
but it didn't move yogurt.
We see Mr. Van Brunt sitting in a decaying 1950s-style ad
agency. The walls are decorated with old ads, including
"50 Million Cigarette Smokers Can't Be Wrong", "If You Like
Ike, You'll Love Anderson Septic Tanks", and "Join The Army
And See The opposing Army".
LISA
So you must know how to stop those
things.
MR. VAN BRUNT
(THOUGHTFULLY) Well, sir, advertising
is a funny thing. If people stop
paying attention to it, pretty soon it
goes away.
LISA
Like that old woman who couldn't find
the beef?
MR. VAN BRUNT
Exactly. If you stop paying attention
to the monsters, they'll lose their
powers.
LISA
But people can't help lookihg at them.
They're wrecking the town.
MR. VAN BRUNT
You know, maybe a jingle would help.
He goes over to a piano and begins noodling around on the
keys.
MR. VAN BRUNT (CONT'D)
(HALF SINGING) Don't watch the •••
(DIFFERENT MELODY) ... don't watch
the ..•• (FANCY MOVE) ••. monstersssss.
(BEAT) It'll sound a lot better comin'
outta Paul Anka.
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - A LITTLE LATER
Lisa stands on the roof of a sound truck with PAUL ANKA as
Mr. Van Brunt drives them down the street . The townspeople
are watching, agog, as the monsters destroy what's left of
their town. (Lenny is leaning forward at an unnatural
angle, like Buster Keaton, with the widest eyes
imaginable.)

LISA
Hey, Springfield! Are you suffering
from the heartbreak of (DEEP VOICE)
monsteritis? (NORMAL VOICE) Then take
a tip from Mr. Paul Anka •••
PAUL ANKA
(SINGING) To stop those monsters 1-2-3
/ Here's a fresh new way that's trouble
free/ It's got Paul Anka's guarantee/
LISA
(SINGING) Guarantee void in Tennessee.
LISA / PAUL ANKA
(SINGING) Just don't look!/ Just
don't look!
During the above, citizens turn their attention away from
the monsters and toward the sound truck. They tap their
feet and slowly join in.
LISA/ PAUL ANKA / TOWNSPEOPLE
SINGING) Just don't look!/ Just
don't look!
ON PAUL BUHYAN AND THE GIANT EXTERMINATOR
We see them PUNCHING buildings, then noticing that no one
is watching them. They gesture to each other a la "what
gives," then start showing off, PUNCHING the buildings with
even more ferocity.
LISA/ PAUL ANKA / TOWNSPEOPLE
(SINGING) Just don't look!/ Just
don't look!
Jf04 FINAI, 1 4/ 21/95 Page 14.
ANGLE ON ALL THE MONSTERS
With no one watching them, they start to lose their
strength. The Red Devil, the Duff Cowboy, and the giant
Kent Brockman begin to stagger, GASP, and topple over.
Several of the monsters huddle together and we hear FRANTIC
WHISPERING. When they emerge from the huddle, they begin a
trendy hip-hop dance routine -- with Professor Peanut as
the lead, and the Zip Boys as backups. The Atomic Octopus
POUNDS out the rhythm on the historic Bongo Building.
BART
What are they doing?
MR. VAN BRUNT
They're trying to get hip to the times.
It's what advertisers do when they're
desperate. Remember Rap-Master
Kenmore?
The monsters weaken a little more when they see their ploy
isn't working. The citizens continue to shield their eyes
and HUM THE JINGLE.
After a beat, we hear a horrendous GROANING and CREAKING of
metal.
BART
(TRYING NOT TO LOOK) What are they
doing now?
MR. VAN BRUNT
(MATTER OF FACT) Sex sells. So they're
having sex.
MARGE
Children, don't look.
3f04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 h:1.ge .:>.
BART
(CAJOLING) But Mom, it's just a
beautiful act of respect between two
consenting monsters •••
With a GRUNT, Marge twists Bart's head away. Every
building in sight is covered with the shadows of monsters
having sex.
ON THE MONSTERS - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
With no one looking, the monsters GASP and topple over one by one. As a last act of defiance, they try to land on
valuable buildings, including the orphanage and the
hospital. A kamikaze Aladdin nosedives into the Birthplace
of Norman Vincent Peale.
LISA
It workedl They're all deadl
BART
Well, except for Chubsy-Ubsy over
there.
Bart points. ZIP PAN to the one remaining monster, Lard
Lad, who seems to be regaining his strength. He's holding
a crudely lettered sign that says "Now With Sprinkles!" as
he waggles his giant donut nticingly.
ON HOMER
He is staring at Lard Lad, mesmerized.
HOMER
Mmmm •••• sprinkles.
MARGE
Homer, stop lookingl
LISA
Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad.
Homer MOANS in frustration and turns away.

3F04 FINAL 1 4/21/95 Page 16.
ON LARD LAD
He weakens, collapses and dies. The donut slips out of his
hand and rolls off down the road past a sign that reads
"Birthplace of Paul Anka -- 1 Mile."
PAUL ANKA
Oh no! My beloved Ankabello!
He runs off in pursuit of the donut.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - !ATER
In the background, the Simpsons pick through the remnants
of their house as Kent Brockman does a news report from the
street. We PUSH slowly in on him so that, by the end, his
face fills the frame a la Criswell in "Plan 9 From Outer
Space."
KENT BROCKMAN
Even as I speak, the scourge of
advertising could be heading toward
your town. (BUILDING) Lock your
doors. Bar your windows. Because the
next advertisement you see could
destroy your house and eat vour family.
HOMER

PAN DOWN from a street sign reading "Evergreen Terrace" to
BART and SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER playing in the Simpson yard.
In a corner of the yard, we vaguely see someone raking
leaves.
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER
(HAPPY BARKING)
BART
Okay, boy, catch the Frisbee!
He tosses a Frisbee. The dog leaps and catches it in his
mouth.
BART (CONT'D)
Good catch, boy.
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER
(UPPER-CLASS VOICE) Thanks, Bart.
The dog stands and tosses the Frisbee to Bar... Bart
leaps, but the Frisbee BONRS off his head. His eyes
KACHINGl with "No Sale" signs as a cartoon bump encircled by TWEETING birds rises from his head.
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER (CONT'D)
(SYMPATHETIC) Oh, hard luck.
Bart shakes it off with a FLAPPING MOUTH "YADDA" SOUND.
As Bart picks up the Frisbee, a menacing shadow shaped like
"Freddy Kruger" falls over him •. Bart looks up and his eyes
bug out Tex Avery-style as he sees GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE (in
a striped sweater and hat) brandishing a rake. Bart holds
up a Wile E. coyote-type sign reading "YIPES!"

In her outstretched hand, she holds two points.of yellow

who have one continuous scratch across both of them, and
Nelson, who is incredibly shiny and polished. He sparkles.
