ACT ONE
EXT. BUS ON SPRINGFIELD STREET - ESTABLISHING SHOT
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
3A.R.T and MILHOUSE are passengers on the bus. They jump.
from their seats and approach the BUS DRIVER.
BART
(TO DRIVER} I believe we'll get off
here, my good man.
BUS DRIVER
This ain't a limo, kid. You'll get off
at the next stop and not before.
Bart nods to Milhouse 1 who hovers over the driver 1
s
shoulder.
MILHOUSE
(FAKING) Uh-oh, I think I'm gonna
t:hrow up.
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
The bus jerks t·o an inst.ant stop. Bart and Milhouse exit,
laughing at the driver.
Bl'-R.T /MILHOUSE
(TAUNTING DRIVER) Sucker[
1
The angry driver slams the door shut and hits the gas,
leaving Bart and Milhouse in a cloud of exhaust. They
start gasping and coughing.
MILHOUSE
Uh-oh, I think I'm gonna throw up.
EXT. SIDEWALK - A SHORT TIME LATER
Bar~ and Milhouse stop walking and look up at a
storefront.
BART
Ah. No day would be completely wasted
without a visit to ye olde joke shop.
We see a joke shop called 11 Yuk-ingham Palace." {The logo
shows two British Palace Guards laughing uproariously.) A
sign over the doorbell reads, "Ring for Entry." Milhouse
pushes it and a stream of water SPRAYS him in the eye.
MILHOUSE
(SPUTTERING NOISES)
BART
(LAUGHS) Rookie mistake, Milhouse.
Ba~t grabs the doorknob and a spring-loaded boxing glove
pops out and HITS him in the knee.
BART (CONT'D)
(PAINED GRUNT)
INT. YUK-INGHAM PALACE - A MINUTE LATER
Bart and Milhouse enter the store. Bart whips out a
twenty-dollar bill.
BART
Oh man, twenty bucks to spend on
anything I want. And my mom told me to
put it in my college fund. Now that
would've been a waste.
2
. . _;:;'-. !-'.ILHOUSE
(INCREDULOUSi Yeah, like we won't be
getting scholarships.
3
As they enter, we see the store is jammed with all kinds of
p:r;actical jokes and novelty items: masks, rubber chickens,
plastic asses, etc. Bart peruses a rack of novelties,
including nitching Powder,'' nsneezing Powder, 11 and
«cardiac-Arrest Powder.n
MILHOUSE
Check it out, Bart! X-ray specs!
Milhouse puts on a pair of spiral-lens glasses. He looks
over at the CLERK.
MILHOUSE'S POV
The c:erk looks completely normal.
MILHOUSE {CONT'D)
Hey. These don't work.
CLERK (WISE-GUY VOICE)
(COVERING) Uhh ... (COVERING NOISE,
POINTING AT HIS CHEST)
Milhouse holds up the glasses.
MILHOUSE
Lead shirt.
I'll take three pairs! Here's my
prescription.
Milhouse hands a piece of paper to the clerk. Bart is
examining all the merchandise and is clearly overwhelmed by
the many choices. He picks up an item that pictures a man
in a top-hat and tails at a society event wit~ his pants
around his ankles, while a kid holding a device around the
corner laughs uproariously.
BA...'q_T
Decisions, decisions. Okay, I can buy
one electronic de-pantser ...
He pushes a button on the device and his own pants fall
down. Milhouse laughs and Bart quickly pulls up his pants
and puts the device down. He picks up another item that
shows a man dressed as a doctor standing next to a weeping
patient.
BA.R.T (CONT'D)
Or. . . (READING ALOUD FROM PACKAGE) ...
five of nooctor Zanyrs False-Positive
Terminal Disease Test KitTs 11 .
(PONDERS) Hm.~, Pr~ncipal Skinner does
have his annual physical coming up ...
MILHOUSE
Or you could buy this ten-pack of sharp
things to put on people 1 s chairs.
Milhouse holds up a plastic bag containing thumbtacks,
knives, syringes, sharks teeth, etc. Bart looks at the
package and tosses it aside. He approaches the clerk.
Maybe you can help me. I don't think
my face is as hilarious as it could be.
What can you show me in a nose or
forehead accessory?
EXT. SIDEWALK - A MINUTE LATER
4
Bart emerges from the store wearing a fake water faucet oL
his forehead, a toucan beak over his nose, and Frankenstein
bolts on his neck.
MILHOUSE
(TO BART, IMPRESSED) WWWhoal Looking
sharp.
Bart smiles, revealing oversized, crooked, discolored,
British-style plastic teeth in his mouth.
5
BART
(BRITISH ACCENT) Well. Thanks,
g->.1v'nor.
The faucet POPS off his forehead. A second later, the rest
of the novelties DROP OFF.
BART
(DISAPPOINTED MOAN)
MILHOUSE
If you put dog doo on the suction cups,
they1 ll stick better.
BART
Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo
that's been on the ground and put it on
my face. I have a better idea.
INT. POWER PLANT - HOMER'S WORKSTATION - A LITTLE LATER
Bart and.Milhouse are JABBING HOMER, who's slumped in his
chair~
BART
Hey Dad, wake up.
HOMER
Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? (PRETENDING TO
BE BUSY) I'~ awakel I 1 m awakel I'm a
productive me~~e~ of Che team! You
can't fire me, I q_uitl (PANICKING
NOISES)
Homer clumsily SLAPS at some bu~tons before noticing it's
just Bart.
BART
Relax, Dad. It 1 s just me. I was
wondering if you had any industrial
strength adhesive: could use on my
face.
HOMER
Well, let's see what we got in the 01 1
drawer. (HiJMS)
Homer OPENS a drawer and begins RUMMAGING through it.
HOMER {CONT 1 D}
Eh. Eh.
6
We see a half-eaten sandwich, Homer 1 s Grammy award, and a
glowing uranium rod. At the bottom he finds a tube of glue
which has leaked a little. Homer struggles to pull it out.
HOMER (CONT'D)
(GRUNTING NOISES)
The tube finally RIPS loose, taking a jagged chunk of the
drawer bo~tom with it. Homer hands it to Bart.
HOMER (CONT' D)
Hope this stuff holds.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
MARGE picks up a camera as LISA reads a pamphlet entitled,
nTreasures of Isis. 11 There's a picture of a pyramid and a
glowing sphere on it.
LISA
This exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime
event. I~'s the first time these
Egyptian artifacts have been allowed
out of England.
MJ..RGE
Just let me put some film in the
camera, and then we'll hop in the car.
You can get a picture of your Mommy
with a mummy'" (CH\JCKLES TO SELF)
Marge opens the back cf the camera and a partially exposed
roll o= film FALLS OUT.
t-1ARGE {CONT' D)
Whoops!
Oh, well.
There goes Carlsbad Caverns.
Marge puts new film in and SNAPS the camera shut. We see
the end of the film sticking out of the camera door.
LISA
Come on, Mom! LetTs got Cameras
aren't allowed in the museum anyv.,ay.
Oh. Well, let me just get my sketch
pad.
LISA
(EXCITED) Oh, I can 1 t waitl In just
half an hour, we'll be in a hinetyminute line to see the Orb of Isis.
The fyont door flies OPEN, and we see Bart 1 s forehead
faucet and coucan noSe protruding into the room.
BART (0 .S.)
'::'a-da l
Marge and Lisa turn to see the novelty-covered Bart.
BART
Notice anything new?
7
MARGE
(ANGRY) Bart! What have I told you
about throwing money away at that joke
shop?
BART
(NERVOUS) To try and cut back a
little?
MARGE
(ANNOYED Mu"i,,MURi Take those silly
things off.
Bart at~empts to remove the faucet, but it won't budge.
BA..~T
(GRUNTS) It won't come off.
Marge grabs the nose and t.ries to twist it off. Bart's
head is yanked side-to-side.

Marge grabs MAGGIE and hurriedly leads Bart out the door,
pulling him by the faucet.

Lisa runs out after Marge and Bart.
LISA

Marge starts to
LISA
Well, can I take the bus?
MARGE
(APOLOGETIC MURMURi I 1 m sorry, but

you can take the bus.
LISP.
But you've let Bart take the bus alone
since he was my age.

Is it just
No, no, it's because Bart has always
been mature and responsible and ...
Marge looks over at Bart covered in novelties.
MARGE ( CO!\'T ' D)
(CONFOUh'TlED) ... Oh, I don't know
why it is. You just can't. I'm sorry,
honey.
Marge gets in _the car and starts backing out of the
driveway~
LISA
( PLEADING) But it's the last day of
the Isis exhibit!
BART
Maybe you should have thought of that
before I glued all this stuff to my
face.
The car ZOOMS off.
INT. POWER PLANT - HOMER'S WORKSTATION - A MINUTE LATER
Homer is asleep in his chair. The phone RINGS. Homer
snaps awake and starts desperately SLAPPING buttons once
aga:.n.
HOMER
(HALF-CONSCIOUS NOISES)
There's another RING. Homer picks up the phone.
HOMER (CONT' D)
Yello?
INTERCUT WITH LISA ON KITCHEN PHONE
LISA

HOMER
(ANNOYED) Who is this?
11
LISA
It 1 s Lisa. I just called to tell you
how much I love you and can I take the
bus to the museum?
HOMER
Museum? I don't like the sound of
that. What did your mother say?
LISA
(COVERING) !Ll-in,... I wasn't a hundred
per cent clear on that, She said
something, but she was kind of in a
rush to get Bart to the emergency room.
HOMER
(CONCERNED) Hmm. So you want to take
the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a
pretty big decision ...
LISA
Well ... if it would put your mind at
ease, I could take a limousine~ (SLY)
Although that would cost two hundred
HOMER
Two hundred dollars?!
there any other way?
LISA
(GROANS) Isn't
Hmm. I guess I 'could take the bi.ls, if
you think that's a better idea.
12
HOMER
Frankly, I do. I knew you had your
heart set on a limo, but sometimes
daddies have to say no, honey. I'm
afraid you're gonna have to take the
bus.
Lisa smiles and pumps her fist.
LISA
(FAKE DISAPPOINTMENT) Oh, all right.
HOMER
Atta girl.
EXT. BUS STOP - A SHORT TIME LATER
13
Lisa is waiting at the bus stop with MOE and a few LOCALS.
She consults a colorful bus-route map on the side of the
bus shelter~
LISA
(TRYING TO BE NONCHALANT) Ah, the old
Number 22. Clean, reliable public
transportation. The chariot of the
people. The ride of choice for the
poor and very poor alike. Sure, some
folks prefer--
MOE
Jh, you gettin' on this next bus, kid?
LISA
Yes.
MOE
(WIUSTLES LOUDLY) Taxi !
14
A cab pulls up to the curb and Moe gets in. It speeds off.
The bus approaches.
LISA
(GASP, THEN EXCITED, TO UNINTERESTED
PATRONS} Lookl It's the bus! The
bus! Come on, you're gonna miss the
bus!
Lisa starts flagging it down wildly. The bus STOPS and the
others elbow their way in front of her. She finally steps
o~f the curb onto the bus, pausing in the doorway to
commemorate ~he moment.
LISA (CONT'D)
That's one small step f-- Whoa!
We hear a WHOOSH as the door closes, propelling Lisa onto
the bus.
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
Lisa drops her coins into the money box. She looks up at a
sign that re,ids, "Your driver today, LARRY."
LISA
(CHEERY} Hi, Larry.
LARRY points at a sign which reads, "Do not talk to
driver."
LISA (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, it's just that on the school
bus-- (AWKWARD LAUGH)
Larry TAPS the sign repeatedly. Lisa gives up. She walks
down the aisle and sees an open seat next to MRS. SKINNER.
LISA (CONT'D)
May ::: sit tt.ere?
15
MRS. SKINNER
(SWEETLY) Of course not, honey. That
seat's for my coin purse.
She places a tiny coin purse on the seat next to her. Lisa
continues down che aisle. She sees COMIC BOOK GUY wearing
a medieval helmet and a sh!.rt that read!l, "Dungeon Master"
in gothic lettering.
LISA
May: have that seat?
COMIC BOOK Gl.JY
Yes ... if you can answer me these
questions three. Question the first--
LISA
Never mind.
Lisa quickly walks to the rear of the bus and sits in an
empty seat in the last row.
LISA (CONT'D)
(CONTENTED SIGH)
We hear the bus' engine GROWL, and a cloud of black diesel
smoke comes up through the floor.

How could I have taken the wrong bus?
I am such a goof us. ( SIGHS) Well, I

Lisa stops 1 takes a DEEP BREATH and calms herself down.
LISA (CONT'Di
Okay, the museum· s got to be north of

Lisa notices a "V" formation of GEESE flying overhead.
LISA (CONT'D)
Ahal It's springtime, so the geese
must be flying back north.
A second flock of GEESE approaches from the opposite
direction.
LISA (CONT'D}
Hey!
The two flocks meet in mid-air. They begin FIGHTING

Marge and Bart, with the novelties still stuck to his face,
are sea~ed in the waiting room. The door OPENS and another
BOY enters with his MOTHER. The new kid also has a faucet
protruding from his forehead.
MARGE
(LECTURING} See, Bart? There's
an:ither boy who played with glue.
FAUCET-HEAD KID'S MOTHER
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Actually, it was a

INT. POWER PLANT - CAFETERIA - LUNCHTIME
Homer, LENNY, and CARL are NOISILY EATING lunch. Carl is
wearing a cardboard hat shaped like an Egyptian pyramid.
CARL
So, uh, ain't you guys gonna ask me
about my hat?
HOMER/LENlIY
(NOTICING SOUNDS)
LENNY
Hey Carl, what's with the hat?
CARL
Oh, what, this thing? I got it down at
the museum. It's what the ancient
Egyptians call a 11 souvenir. 11
HOMER
My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy

take a limo, but I made her take the
bus.

HOMER
(WARILY) MMMaybe ... but you don't know
Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they
hooked her up to a big computer to try
to teach it some things, but she had so
much knowledge it overloaded and then
it got really hot and caught on fire.
Lenny and Carl stare at Homer for a beat.
CARL
That never, uhh, happened, did it,
Homer?
HOMER
(W?...,AKLY) Uh, yesss ... but now I have
to leave on a totally unrelated matter.
Excuse me.

Lisa is walking past a junkyard, head down, KICKING.an old
air filter.
LISA
(MUTTERING) Stupid bus that can't even

She goes to kick the air filter again and realizes that
she's about to kick a flattened SQUIRREL.
LISA (CONT'D)

INT. HOSPITAL - DR. HIBBERT'S EXAMINING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Bart is seated on the examining table as DR. HIBBERT takes
a closer look at the novelties on his face.
DR. HIBBERT

products in her face: a live, wriggling STURGEON, spinning
plates, Khlav Khalash, weird marionettes, etc. A mangy,
salivating BElL'<. wearing a toy hat and roller skates offers
her a tray of collector pins.

EXT. SPRINGSON:tAN MUSEUM - A LITTLE LATER
27
Homer SCREECHES up in his car and runs into the museum~
There is a large Calder Stabile in the front courtyard, arid
a banner hanging over the door that reads, uTreasures of
Isis. " (There is a picture of a pyramid and an orb on the
banner.) The museum has huge glass windows on the
stairwell so we can see Homer frar:tically running, from
floor to floor~
HOMER
(CALLING OUT) Lisa?! Lisa?t Lisa?!
28
A worried Homer re-emerges wearing a souvenir Pharaoh's
headdress and holding a pyramid-shaped ice cream pop.
Homer hurriedly FINISHES the pyramid pop and runs down the
sidewalk. (His headdress flies off.)
HOMER (CONT'D)
Oh, where is she?
Homer approaches a passing mailman.
HOMER (CONT' D)
Have you seen my little girl? She's
eight years old and lost in the big
city because I let her take the bus all
alone.
Got a pict~re of her?
HOMER
(OFFENDED) Sure, what kind of a father
do you think I am?
Homer opens his wallet and starts flipping through photos.
HOMER (CONT'D)
(SHOWING MAILMAN) Here she is ... no,
that's Barney ... BaYney again .. ~ Ooh,
that's a nice shot my bar stool down at
Moe's .... that's Loni Anderson. She
came with the wallet.
Homer finally finds a photo of Lisa and shows it to him.
HOMER iCONT'D)
Here's Lisa. Have you seen her?
MAILMAN
I see a lot of people, but I don't
remember seeing her.
HOMER
(PULLS OUT TWENTY DOLLA..~ BILL, CAGEY)
Well, maybe this will refresh your
memory ...
Homer stuffs the money in the mailman's shirt pocket.
MAILMAN
(LOOKS AGAIN) You're right. I 1 m sure
I haven 1 t seen her.
The mailman exits with Homer's money.
HOMER
(COCKY) I knew ~hat would help.
29
Homer then runs into the street, waving the picture of Lisa
at DRIVERS as they HONK and SWERVE around him.
HOMER
(FRANTIC) Have you seen my little
girl?
One car pulls to a stop. Homer starts BANGING on the
window.
HOMER (CONT'D)
For GodFs sakes, my little girl is--
The window rolls down, revealing Marge.
HOMER (CONT'D)

Marge DRIVES OFF.
Oh, sorry.

Homer leans back on another car. The window rolls down,
revealing MR. BURNS.
HOMER (CONT'D)
(SHORT SCREAM)
MR. B\J1L'{S
Shouldn't you be at work right now?
HOMER
(NERVOUSLY) Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns,
sir.
MR. BURNS
Well then, get back to wherever it is
you work, whoever you are.
30
The window ROLLS back up and the car drives away. Homer
spots a nearby woman and approaches her from the back.
HOMER
Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this
girl?
The woman tu:,cns around and we see it is CHIEF WIGGUM in
drag.
CHIEF WIGGl,'M
Uh, I'd love to help you, pal, but I'm,
on a stakeout, here. {UNDER JAILBIRD)
And--
JAILBIRD runs up and snatches Wiggum's purse.
JiULBIRD
Yoink! Haw-haw!
CHIEF WIGGUM
Ohl Aw~ Oh, great. All my stuff was
in that purse. (CALLING OUT) Somebody
stop that awful, awful man!
Homer sadly walks away.
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER
The sidewalk is jammed with PEDESTRIANS. Homer's head
periodically pops up over the crowd.
HOMER
(MOAN I GR1Jh"TS, THEN AS HE JUMPS}
Lisa. . . Lisa .. .
HOMER'S POV
His view is obscured by the heads of the people in the
crowd.
::n
HOMER (CONT'D)
(FRUSTRATED NOISE) This is no good.
I've got to get up higher.
He approaches a STREET VENDOR selling helium balloons.
HOMER ( C01'"1" DJ
Give me all your balloons.
Homer hands him a wad of cash and takes the balloons.
HOMER ( CON'.):" D)
I hope this works ...
32
Homer turns to a TELEPHONE REPAIR1".AN emerging from a cherry
picker.
HOMER ( CDNT' D)
These are for you if you let me use
your cherry picker.
TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN
(CONSIDERING) Well ... I've already got
some balloons. But they're not this
nice. Deal.
He walks off with the balloons. Homer hops in the cherr1
picker and slowly starts GOING UP.
ANGLE ON LISA
who rounds the corner into the bustling crowd that Homer
was jusc in~ She looks at the sea of legs rushing past
her, and tries to get people's attention.
LISA
Excuse me, ma'am? Uh, hello?
Somebody? Anybody? {WEARY SIGH)
Lisa sits down on the curb and hangs her head. Unseen by
her, Homer rises up above the crowd in the cherry picker
basket about a block away.
33
HOMER
Lisa? Lisa? (SEES LISA, GASP) Lisa!
Lisa looks up excitedly, then leaps to her feet with joy.
LISA
Dad!
HOMER
(CALLING OUT) Stay there! I'm coming
to save you!
Homer presses the joysticks forward. The cherry picker
LURCHES, but doesn't move. He starts furiously working the
controls for#ard and back. As the vehicle JERKS around,
the chocks are JOSTLED out from under the wheels. Lisa
watches in disbelief as the cherry picker starts to roll
backwards, then plummets out of control down an extremely
steep incline.
HOMER (CONT' D)
Lisa! Save me!
FADE OUT:
END OF ACT TWO
ACT THREE
FADE IN:
EXT. STEEP ROAD - CONTINUOUS
The cherry picker continues hurtling downhill.
HOMER
(FADING SCREAM}
LISA
I'm coming, Dad!
34
Lisa runs after him. A panicked Homer works the joysticks
frantically, but only succeeds in raising and lowering
himself. He rises to the maximum height and his head SLAMS
into a hanging traffic light.
HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT)
He lowers himself to the ground, causing the metal basket
to SCRAPE on the street. A huge shower of SPARKS engulfs
Homer.
HOMER (CONT' D)
(BIGGER ANNOYED GRUNT)
He quickly raises himself again.
HOMER (CONT'D)
{RELIEVED SIGH)
LISA
Look outl
The cherry picker rolls off the street and onto a long
wooden pier that extends out into Springfield River.
HOMER
Oh, no! I'm gorilla go off the end of
the pier!
-;;),
-:,j
35
Just then, the wooden planks GIVE WAY beneath him, and the
cherry picker PLUNGES straight through the pier into the
water. Homer remains atop the extended arm of the cherry
picker, which continues forward, SLICING through the rest
of the pier.
HOMER (CONT'D)
(QUICK SERIES OF PAINED NOISES)
The cherry picker quickly floats downstream with Homer high
above the water.
HOMER (CONT' D)
(LOOKS SKYWARD) ·I'm not normally a
praying man, but if you're up there,
please save me, Superman.
EXT • RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS
Lisa approaches a drawbridge, which is in the "up"
position. (A ship has just passed through it.) Lisa rems
to the bridge operator's booth.
LISA
Hurry! Hurry! Lower the bridge so my
dad can grab onto it!
BRIDGE OPERATOR
You're the boss.
He presses a button. The two halves of the bridge begin to
CLOSE slowly. As Homer passes underneath, the bridge
CLOSES, catching his head in between the two halves. The
cherry picker floats away as Homer dangles from the bridge.
He sees Lisa looking down at him over the railing.
HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT, 7HEN PAINED NOISE) Oh,
Lisa, thank God you're okay!
A couple of cars run over the top of Homer~s head.
HOMER (CONT' D)
Owwl
EXT. OPERATOR'S BOOTH - CONTINUOUS
BRIDGE OPERATOR
(CALLING TO LISA) You said crush him,
right?
LISA
No!
BRIDGE OPERATOR
No?
LISA
No!
The disappointed bridge operator pulls a lever. We hear
the motor STOP.
EXT. STREET - LATER
Lisa and Homer walk toward the car.
LISA
Are you sure you don't want to go to a
doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did close
on your head.
HOMER
Nab, I'll just walk it off.
LISA
IFm sorry, Dad. None of ~his would
have happened if I hadn't tricked you
into letting me take the bus.
HOMER
That's okay. The important thing , C .... ..., 1
no harm was done.
36
37
As they walk off-screen, we WIDEN to reveal the drawbridge
behind them. It's covered with firetrucks, an ambulance,
the Jaws of Life, and a NEWS CREW packing up. A WORKER
pu~s up a sign that readsr "BRIDGE OUT. n
INT. HOMER' S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Homer and Lisa are driving home.
LISA
(DOWNCAST) I should have known I
wasn't old enough to take the bus
alone, but I really wanted to see that
exhibit. I 1 ll never take another
stupid risk like that again!
Homer SLAMS on the brakes.
HOMER
(FIRM) Don't ever say that.
LISA
What:.?
HOMER
(ADAMANT) If I hadn'ta taken a stupid
risk with that cherry picker, I never
would have found you.
LISA
(TENTATIVE) I guess ...
HOMER
Stupid risks are what make life worth
living. Now your mother, she's the
steady type, and that's fine in small
doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. And
that's why I have so many adventures.
LISA
(ALARMED) Uh, Dad! You're headed for
the pier again,
We see the car rolling backwards down the hill toward the
water. Homer HITS the bra)qes.
HOMER
(CHUCKLES) Feel your heart pumping a
mile a minute? That,s what my heart's
doing all the time. Bet your left
arm's tingling too, huh?
LISA
Dad, are you all right?
HOMER
I'm enjoying my life too much to care.
And you should be too. (GETTING REWED
UP) So what would you like to do right
now, more than anything in the world?!
LISA
Go to the museum?
HOMER
(DISAPPOINTED MOAN)
LISA
Don't worry, it 1 s closed.
HOMER
(INTRIGL'ED SOUND) Closed, eh? Wellll,
now it's getting interesting.
Homer throws the car into gear and SQUEALS away.
38
EXT. SPRINGSONIAN MUSEUM - EARLY EVENING
A SECURITY GU&.~D patrols past the front of the museum,
sweeping the area wit:h his flashlight. Once he walks
offscreen, we PAN up the Calder stabile to see Homer and
Lisa hanging from one of its swinging arms.
HOMER
Just a little higher ...
39
Homer moves a couple inches outwards, tilting Lisa's end up
hi-gher. Lisa grabs the next rung up,, then moves over so
her rung tilts toward Homer. He grabs it and hangs next to
her. Then Lisa scrambles all the way _t:~ the far end,
tilting Homer up to the next level.
LISA
Dad, I'm kind of scared.
HOMER
Good. You're gonna need that adrenalin
to make the final jump.
Homer leaps a few feet through the air toward the museum,
and lands on a third-story ledge, under an air vent. A
second later. Lisa leaps after him. He catches her and
puts her down next to him.
HOMER/LISA
(GIGGLE)
Homer SWINGS OPEN the vent grating and they both crawl in.
INT. EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER SCENE ll
CLOSE UP on another vent panel. One by one, the four
screws holding it on unscrew and DROP to the floor. The
panel then falls loose, revealing that it's just large
enough for Homer's hand to fit through -- the vent is in
the center of a much larger door. Homer reaches his arm
through the tiny opening, grabs the handle of the door, and
pulls it OPEN. He and Lisa slip out into the dimly lit
room. Lisa gazes around in wonder.
LISA
(HlJSHED) Wowww. It's magnificent.
40
LISA'S POV
The .room is filled with impressive artifacts, including
golden Pharaoh masks, chunks of stone covered with
hieroglyphics, sarcophagi, mummies, carvings of cats and
scarabs, and a throne. The ceiling lights are off, but the
individual exhibits are beautifully lit.
LISA (CONT'D)
Now I know how Sir Dudley Winthrop felt
when he first fell through the ceiling
and. discovered ... the Temple of Isis.
HOMER
Aw, I'm glad ycu like it.
Lisa walks over to some small carved figures.
LISA
Have you ever seen such exquisite
Ushabtis?
HOMER
Uh. . . not in some time.
Lisa notices something.
LISA
Ooh, the Sphinx's nose.
She approaches a gigantic stone nose. Homer leans over and
peers up the nostril.
HOMER
(IMPRESSED NOISE) Nicely trimmed.
Lisa notices an illuminated pedestal surrounded by a velvet
rope. On it sits a softball-sized stone orb decorated with
hieroglyphics.
LISA
{GASP) Ohmigosh! It's the mysterious
Orb of Isis.
She runs over to it, stopping at the velvet rope.
LISA (CONT'D)
(GAZING IN WONDER) Archaeologists have
been studying it for decades, and still
have no clue what it means.
HOMER
Well, Daddy will figure it out.
Homer steps toward the orb. Lisa grabs his arm.
LISA
Oh! We can't touch
behind a velvet rope!
A velvet rope.
HOMER
Dad. It's
(WITH REVERENCE)
(PATRONIZING) Lisa, if they really
wanted to keep people away, they'd put
up something a little more serious than
a velvet--
41
Homer unhooks the velvet rope from its post and an electric
charge COURSES through his body.
HOMER {CONT'D)
{PAINED ELECTRIFIED NOISE)
Homer lets go of the rope and the electricity stops.
HOMER (CONT' D)
When we're done here, Daddy really has
to go to the hospital.
Herner picks up the orb.
LISA
Carefull It 1 s priceless.
HOMER
Now it may be old, but Itm sure it's
worth something. Think fast::
Homer tosses ~he orb to a horrified Lisa.
and hits the floor with a loud CRACK.
LISA
(GJ>.SP) You broke it!
HOMER
(SAD MOAN) I'm sorry, Sweetie.
It falls short
I
never thought this would happen when I
hurled the artifact. I shoulda never
have--
42
Suddenly, the orb starts to open like an intricate puzzle.
Sweet, ethereal, unearthly MUSIC emanates from it. A
stunned Homer and Lisa take a closer look. Inside the orb
they see primitive wooden workings playing a tiny harp.
LISA
It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered
the secret!
HOMER
Oh., so now it 1 s ~., eh.
Homer and Lisa listen to the music for a moment, ent~anced.
LISA
It's so beautiful. A,.~d just think,
we're the first people to hear its song
in more than four thousand years.
Lisa hugs Homer.
~ LISA (C01''T' D)
{HUGGING SOUND) Thanks for making me
take such a stupid risk, Dad.
HOMER
Anytime, honey. Anytime. (BEAT) Now
let f s get out of here;, We only have
five minutes left on the parking meter._
Homer picks up the orb, presses the halves back together 1
and places it back on the pedestal. He and Lisa walk to
the air vent.
LISA
It's kind of humbling, isn1 t it? The
music we just heard might never be
heard again.
HOMER
Yeah, .. but it'll always live on 1
because we'll never forget it.
43
Homer starts WHISTLING the ancient music. After the first
few notes, he lapses into t.he ''Old Spice" theme song.
LISA
Dad, that's the Old Spice song.
HOMER
It is? (BEAT) Well ... that's a good
scng too.
Homer enters the vent and starts crawling away_.
HOMER (0. S.)
(CONTINUES WHISTLING "OLD SPICE" THEME)
Lisa stares after Homer for a beat.
LISA
(WHISTLING "OLD SPICE" THEME)
Lisa enters the air vent too.

As Homer and Lisa continue whistling, WE:
