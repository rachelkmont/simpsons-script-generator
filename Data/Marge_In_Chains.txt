Score! Conk 
TROY MCCLURE 
Hello everybody. I’m Troy McClure, 
star of such films as "P is for 
‘Psycho’" and "The President’s Neck 
Is Missing." But now I’m here to 
tell you about a remarkable new 
invention. 


He picks up an orange and clumsily squeezes it with his 
hand over a glass, making a mess. 


TROY MCCLURE 
Until now, this was the only way to 
get juice from an orange. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE = LIVING ROOM = CONTINUOUS 


HOMER watches. He is also squeezing an orange with his 
hand over a glass. 


HOMER 
(GASP) You mean there’s a better way? 
ON TV 
TROY MCCLURE (V.0O.) 
But that’s all changed thanks to the 
"Juice Loosener." Let’s meet the 
inventor, Doctor Nick Riviera. 


DR. NICK enters carrying a large boxy juicer labelled "The 
Juice Loosener." 


DR. NICK 
Hello, Troy. Hi everybody. 
AUDIENCE 


Hi, Doctor Nick! 


Sea ! 
DR. NICK com. 


Troy, would you like a glass of 
orange juice? 
TROY MCCLURE 
I sure would. But won’t we have to 
pay those outrageous grocery store 
prices for something the farmer 
probably spit in? 
DR. NICK 
Not anymore. 
Troy drops his jaw and SLAPS his mouth in disbelief. 
DR. NICK (CONT’/D) 
All, thanks to the new "Juice 
Loosener." 


Dr. Nick pours a bag of oranges into the juicer. We hear a 
hideous GRINDING noise. Pulp flies on Troy’s face. 


TROY MCCLURE 
Doctor, are you sure it’s on? I 
can’t hear a thing. 

DR. NICK 
(YELLING) It’s whisper quiet. 


Dr. Nick finishes. There’s a tiny amount of juice on the 
bottom of the glass. 


TROY MCCLURE 
You got all that from one bag of 


oranges? 



DR. NICK  

That’/s right. Order now and get this 

free historical globe. All the 

countries just like they were in 

1987. 


Troy looks at the globe. 
TROY MCCLURE 
U.S.S.R.? Doesn’t that bring back 
memories? 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 7 Sau a 
Homer picks up the phone and dials. 
HOMER 
Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink 
juice and lose weight. Won’t have to 
have sex in that odd position 
anymore.

CLOSE-UP MAILING LABEL: "HOMER SIMPSON, SPRINGFIELD, USA" 
PULL BACK to see it’s on a box in an assembly line. 


SUPER: OSAKA, JAPAN 
A JAPANESE WORKER puts a juicer into the box. A second 
SICK WORKER stands next to him. They speak in rapid, 
poorly-dubbed English a la "Godzilla" movies. 
SICK JAPANESE WORKER 
Please don’t tell the supervisor I’m sick.

JAPANESE WORKER #2 
(WINKING) Don’t worry. I’ve been 
working with a shattered pelvis for 
three weeks. 
JAPANESE WORKERS 
(POORLY-DUBBED LAUGH) 
The sick worker COUGHS, and we see a cloud of germs 
swirling inside the box. He seals it shut and it goes on 
down the assembly line. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM — DAY 
Homer is sitting on the couch. 
SUPER: 6 TO 8 WEEKS LATER 
BART approaches with the juicer box. 
BART 
Hey, dad. This came in the mail. 
HOMER 
What the hell is it? 
BART 
It’s that juicer that killed three 
people in Iowa. 
HOMER 
(SMUG) Glad I don’t live in Iowa. 


Homer opens the box. A swarm of germs rush out and attack 
Homer‘’s face. 


HOMER

INT. PATTY AND SELMA’S APT.- DAY 


Each holds a gift-wrapped package. 



PATTY Sux 2 


Happy Birthday. 
SELMA 
Happy Birthday. 


They swap packages. They open the packages and each 
contains a juicer. Germs swarm on Patty and Selma. 


PATTY /SELMA

INT. KRUSTY’S DRESSING ROOM = Sox Ss 
A sad-looking LADY sits on the couch. 
KRUSTY 
Look, Cherry. It’s over between us. 
I’m a kid show host, you’re a porn 
star. The tabloids get a hold of 
this, they might pull a Pee Wee on 
me. 
LADY 
But, Krusty... 
KRUSTY 
Now, now. I got you a juicer. 


He hands her the juicer. She opens it. The germs fly out. 
She SCREAMS. SIDESHOW MEL sticks his head in. 


SIDESHOW MEL 
Krusty, Drew Barrymore is here to see 
you. 

KRUSTY 
Give her a juicer and tell her to get 


lost. 



Sco ae 
He takes a juicer from the top of a stack of juicers. oo! 
ON TV 
KENT BROCKMAN looks very sick. Behind him is an "Osaka 
Flu" mortise, with a picture of Godzilla with a thermometer 
in his mouth and an ice bag on his head. 
BROCKMAN 
The dreaded Osaka flu has hit 
Springfield, with over 300 cases now 
reported. Symptoms of the flu 
include: sore throat, nausea, and a 
burning sensation while urinating.

Maybe you better take that 
temperature one more time. 
Bart assumes a look of concentration.

INT. BART’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER 


Bart lies in his pajamas with a cold compress on his head, 
drinking lemonade through a straw. 


BART 

(CHUCKLES) 
He turns on the TV. We see an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. 
TITLE CARD: 
"GERMS OF ENDEARMENT" Itchy is a doctor in his office. 
Scratchy walks in and points to a sign reading: "TODAY’S 
SPECIAL, TONSILLECTOMIES." Scratchy sits on the examining 
table. Itchy reaches down Scratchy’s throat, pulls out 
Scratchy’s tonsils and ties them to a brick. He tosses the 
brick out a window, pulling Scratchy’s tonsils and inards 
out with it. Scratchy SCREAMS and jumps out the window. 
As he falls, he catches up to his innards, and starts 
gobbling them up. He finishes swallowing his innards, 
smiles, then lands on a cactus. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM = CONTINUOUS 
Bart LAUGHS, then starts COUGHING. An art card comes on: 
ON TV 

ANNOUNCER (V.0) 
And now, for an emergency 
announcement from the mayor. 


ART CARD: THE MAYORAL SEAL: “MAYOR OF SPRINGFIELD 
‘CORRUPTUS IN EXTREMIS’" 


We see MAYOR QUIMBY standing in front of the office wall. 
MAYOR QUIMBY 
People of Springfield, because of the 
epidemic, I have cancelled my 
vacation to the Bahamas. 
The camera WIDENS OUT to reveal Quimby wearing Bermuda 
shorts beneath his jacket and tie. He is standing in front 


of a City Hall backdrop on the beach. We hear faint 
Caribbean MUSIC.

Panicked SHOPPERS empty the shelves and rush by with loaded 
carts. A full shelf of boxes marked "Urkel Flakes" sits 
completely untouched. 
B) INT. BURNS’ OFFICE 
BURNS 
Smithers, I’m not worried about this 
Plague. I took the precaution of 
constructing a germ-free chamber for 
myself. Not a single microbe can get 
in or out. 
Burns pushes a button -- the wall slides open revealing an 
antiseptic chamber. Homer sits in the middle of it, eating 
a submarine sandwich. 
BURNS (CONT’D) 
(MAD) Who the devil are you?

C) DR. HIBBERT’S OFFICE 


A PANICKED MOB surrounds the office. HIBBERT looks out an 
upstairs window. 


MOB 
We need a cure! We need a cure! 
HIBBERT 
(CHUCKLES) Why, the only cure is bed 
rest. Anything I give you would only 
be a placebo. 
WOMAN 
(HYSTERICAL) Where do we get these 
placebos? 
MAN 
Maybe there’s some in this truck! 
The mob turns over the truck. A box labelled "KILLER BEES" 
is inside. It smashes open and bees pour out. The man 
pops a bee in his mouth. 
MAN 
I’m cured! I mean ouch! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE = KITCHEN = DAY Saux C

HOMER (0.S.) 

But, I/1l miss "Sheriff Lobo." 
GRAMPA 

Those babies. I made it through the 

Great Spanish Flu of 1918. (PAINED) 

It was an endless nightmare of human 

suffering. 

SPRINGFIELD - 1918 


An idyllic street scene. 200M IN on the window of a 
beautiful Victorian house. A YOUNG GRAMPA sits up in bed. 


DOCTOR 
Abe just has a touch of that Spanish 
Flu. He should be up and about in no 
time. 

YOUNG GRAMPA 


Well, bless my buttons. 




Seite 
GRAMPA’S MOTHER cork 


Thank you, doctor. How much do I owe 
you? 

DOCTOR 
One cent should do it. 


Outside, we hear a band strike up "THE WASHINGTON POST 
MARCH." A jubilant YOUNG NEWSPAPER BOY runs by the window. 


NEWSPAPER BOY 
(TEENAGED VOICE) Wuxtry! Wuxtry! 
The Kaiser surrenders! 
The doctor gazes out the window and takes a PUFF on his 
pipe. From behind, all are silhouetted against a gorgeous 
sunset. 
BACK TO SCENE 
GRAMPA 
.-. And we didn’t have TV, neither. 
If we got bored, we went downtown and 


looked at a woodcut. 


Grampa realizes he is sitting alone in the kitchen. The 
DOG looks at hin.

talk. And don’t you tell me 
different.

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE = DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER 


Marge is pulling out the driveway. A very sick NED 
FLANDERS leans out his window. 


NED 

Howdy, neighbor! (SNEEZES) If you’re 
headed to the store, could you pick 
the boys up some comics -- "King of 
Kings, #6," and "The Martyrdom of St. 
Barnabas, Awesome Origin Ish!" 
INT. FLANDERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The entire FAMILY is racked with disease. 
ROD

TODD

NED 
I wish he were, Rod, I pray for the 
day, but I’m afraid he’s just 
delirious from fever. 
MAUDE 
Why has God forsaken us? 
NED 
I can’t imagine what we could’ve done 
to... (REALIZING) Oh... oh no! 
NED’S FLASHBACK 


Ned flips through the channels on TV and happens to stop on 
a sleazy Fox sitcom. 


HUSBAND 
Peg, you gotta take better care of 
the house. These plants are all 
lifeless and limp! 
WIFE 
Maybe they’d feel more at home in the 
bedroom, Al! 
The STUDIO AUDIENCE erupts in wild HOOTS and HOLLERS, and 
Ned GIGGLES. We hear a loud THUNDER CRACK from the 
heavens. 
INT. PATTY AND SELMA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER 
PATTY and SELMA are sick in bed. Marge serves them soup. 
PATTY 
Thanks for the soup. 
SELMA

bourbon. 
PATTY 
You know what they say, "Booze out a 
cold, smoke out a fever."

behind her. 


MARGE 
And a bottle of aspirin, please. 
APU gets a small bottle of aspirin from behind the counter. 

APU 

The aspirin is $24.95. 
MARGE 

$24.95! What, did you jack up the 

price when everyone got sick? 
APU 

Actually, it’s on sale. 


Apu hands Marge the change and she heads for the door. A 
loud ALARM goes off. She is startled and drops her bag. 
Apu and SANJAY exchange looks. 


APU (CONT’D) 
Oh dear, the alarm must be broken. 


If you could just move a bit to your left... 


APU’S POV 


Marge moves next to the height gauge on the door. 
sizes her up and writes down her vital statistics. 


APU (CONT’D)

Sanjay winks and heads over to Marge. He plucks a bourbon bottle out of her pocket. 
APU 
(SHOCKED GASP) Mrs. Simpson! You did not pay for this bottle of Colonel Kwik-E-Mart’s Kentucky Bourbon. 


He holds up a bottle with a white-haired Indian man dressed 


like a Kentucky Colonel. 
MARGE 


Uh... no, I-I guess I didn’t. 


We hear police SIRENS approaching. Five police cars pull 
into the lot. From outside we hear Wiggum’s voice. 


WIGGUM (V.0) 
(ON BULLHORN) All right. Come out 
with your hands up... two cups of 
coffee... and something with coconut on it... 


Marge looks very sad.

HUTZ 
Now, Marge, this is your first trial. 
Go to court with me five times, and 
you get a free two-liter bottle of 
Pepsi! 
MARGE 
It’s all a misunderstanding. I 
didn’t mean to take anything. 
Hutz looks over some papers. 
HUTZ 
Uh-oh. We’ve drawn Judge Snyder. 
MARGE 
Is that bad? 
HUTZ 
Well, he’s had it in for me ever

MARGE 
You did?

Well, replace the word "kinda" with 
the word "repeatedly," and the word "dog" with "son."

APU 
I’m sorry, Mr. Homer, but it is the 
policy of Kwik-E-Mart and its parent 
corporation, NorDyne Defense 
Dynamics, to prosecute shoplifters to 


the full extent of the law. 


Homer sadly walks out. Apu presses "play" on his tape deck and INDIAN MUSIC plays again.

bottle of... 


Hutz goes to the evidence table and picks up the bourbon 
bottle. 


HUTZ (CONT’D) 
Delicious... bourbon... so 
tempting... so tempting... all my 
problems fading away. Excuse me. 


Hutz runs out of the courtroom. He quickly puts a few 
coins in a pay phone and dials. 


HUTZ (CONT'D) 
Hello, David? (DESPERATE) I’m 


really tempted. 



ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE 6 


is David Crosby. There is a Crosby, Stills and Nash album 
in the background. 


DAVID CROSBY 
One day at a time, man. One day ata 
time. 
BACK TO HUTZ 
HUTZ 
(INSPIRED) Thank you, David. 


He strides purposefully into the courtroom and resumes 
examining Apu. 


HUTZ (CONT'D) 
So, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan, if that 
is your real name, have you ever 
forgotten anthing? 
APU 
No, but my brother Sanjay did. But 
he has been shot in the head so many 
times, you must make allowances. 
HUTZ 
So, you never forget anything? Then 
tell me this... 
Hutz quickly turns away from Apu. 
HUTZ (CONT’D) 


What color tie am I wearing? 


APU Jae " 


You are wearing a red and white 
striped club tie, in a half Windsor 
knot. 
Hutz is wearing a red and white striped club tie, in a half 
Windsor knot. He looks shocked. Hutz starts to remove his 
tie, his back to Apu. 
HUTZ 
Oh, I am, am I? (STUGGLING WITH TIE) 
Is that what you think? Well, if 
that is what you think, I have 
something to tell you. Something 
that may shock and discredit you. 
And that thing is as follows... 
Huts wheels around, bare necked. 
HUTZ (CONT’D) 
I’m not wearing a tie at all. 
The jury GASPS. 
APU 
(GASPS) But, if I am wrong about 
that, maybe I’m wrong about Mrs. 
Simpson. 
HUTZ 
What? (INTRIGUED) Say that again? 
APU 
Mrs. Simpson may be innocent. 
HUTZ 


No further questions. 



INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
The happy family is eating dinner with Hutz. 
MARGE 
Mr. Hutz, you were wonderful today. 
LISA 
Your attack was worthy of a young 
Clarence Darrow. 
HUTZ 
Uh, was he the black guy on the Mod 
Squad? 
BART 
Mr. Hutz, when I grow up I want to be 
a lawyer just like you. 
HUTZ 
Now, son. That means you’ll have to 
go to a Costa Rican college for years 
and take the bar exam 12 times. You 
know, a lot of people said I could 
never be a lawyer and tomorrow I’m 
going to show them all. 
INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY

JUDGE 
Mr. Hutz, do you know you’re not

HUTZ

of the rest of you notice that? 


The JURY FOREMAN raises his hand. 


JURY FOREMAN

good while mother’s in prison. 
BART 
No offense, Mom, but you've been good 
all your life and they’re sending you 
up the river. 
HOMER 
Bart! 
BART 
Just tellin’ it like it is, man. 
HOMER 
Marge, I’m gonna miss you so much. 
And it’s not just the sex... it’s 
also the food preparation... your 
skill with stains of all kinds... the 
way you stop me when I’m saying 
something stupid...

She hugs him. The bailiff puts handcuffs on her and starts 
to lead her out. She passes Apu and Sanjay. 


MARGE

EXT. PRISON YARD -DAY 
A MS. GRUBGUCKER-TYPE prison guard leads Marge. 
MS. GRUBGUCKER-TYPE 
Gotta warn you. This is no place for 
a lady. It’s not like that TV show 
"Women in Prison." 
MARGE 
I don’t remember that. 
MS. GRUBGUCKER-TYPE 
It was part of the original Fox 
Saturday line-up, between Beans 
Baxter and Mr. President. They used 
to test those shows on our convicts. 
INT. PRISON - MARGE’S CELL - A MINUTE LATER 


Marge looks into the cell. Inside, a hulking, MUSCULAR 
WOMAN does bicep curls in a shadowy corner. 


MARGE 
Knock, knock. 


The woman doesn’t answer and Marge tentatively steps 
inside. 


MARGE (CONT’D) 
Uh, I’m Marge Simpson. Your new cellmate.





PHILLIPS FP 

I’m Phillips. They call me that 
‘cause I killed my husband with a 
Phillips-head screwdriver. 
MARGE 
(NERVOUS MURMUR) 
INT. PRISON - DINING HALL - NEXT MORNING 
Marge and Phillips eat with a group of convicts. 
MARGE 
It’s so nice not to have to cook. 
PHILLIPS 
You mean your husband never cooked 
for you? 
MARGE 
(UNCOMFORTABLE) Well... once. 
MARGE’S FLASHBACK 
She is seated at the dining room table for a candle-lit 
dinner. Homer sets a plate with a fish on it in front of 
her. The fish is flopping around wildly into the air. 
MARGE 
Homer, I don’t think this fish is 
dead yet. 
HOMER (0.S.) 
Marge, please. I’m having anough 
trouble with the lobsters. 
We see lobsters are all over Homer, biting him. = Sterv 1b 
BACK TO SCENE 


Marge and Phillips continue eating. A heavily tattooed 
woman walks past. 





MARGE 
Oh my goodness. 
PHILLIPS 
That’s Tattoo Annie. 
TATTOO ANNIE smiles. She turns her back to Marge and takes 
off her shirt revealing her back is heavily tattooed with 
violent images. A caption reads: 


"WHAT KIND OF SLIME 
WOULD I MARRY?" 


MARGE 
(PUZZLED) I don’t understand. 
TATTOO ANNIE 
It’s one of those Mad Magazine fold- 
ins. 
She flexes her back muscles. The picture collapses into a 
picture of Alfred E. Neuman, with the caption: "WHAT ME 
WORRY?" 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Homer stands with the kids. 
HOMER 
Now kids, we’ve got to keep this 
house clean while your mother’s gone, 
so I don’t wanna have to wash any 
dishes. From now on, drink straight 
from the faucet or milk carton, and 
we'll eat while standing over the 
sink or toilet. 
BART 


Who’s gonna change Maggie? 



HOMER 
We're gonna let her roam free in the 
backyard, and nature will take its 
course. 
LISA 
I think if we all do our fair share, 
we can keep this house clean. : Sut Ip;—-

There is garbage all over, including a pizza on the floor 
with footprints in it. SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER is eating 
from the open refrigerator. After a beat, an ALLIGATOR 
crawls by in the foreground. 
Bart and Lisa enter in stained and dirty clothes. 
BART 
Dad! We/re running out of clean 
clothes! 
LISA 
It seems like I’ve been wearing the 
same red dress forever. 
HOMER (0.S.) 
Go up to the attic. There’s a whole 
trunk of clothes up there. 
Homer comes in wearing Marge’s wedding dress.

ON HOMER 
He’s wearing a big red devil’s suit. 
HOMER 
(LYING) Uh... no. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Bart slides a cake box across the table to Marge. 
BART 
(WHISPERING) Okay, Mom, act casual. 


I baked you a cake with a file in it. 


Marge opens the box. There’s nothing inside but a few crumbs. 



LISA


Where’s the cake? 
BART 
Where’s the file? 
Everyone turns to Homer. He smiles nervously and GULPS. 
MARGE 
How are things at home? 
BART 
We flushed the gator down the toilet, 
but it got stuck halfway and now we 
have to feed it.

EXT PRISON YARD - DAY 
We see several trailers. A sign reads: "CONJUGAL VISIT 
TRAILERS." On the bumper of one it says: "DON’T COME A- 
KNOCKIN’ IF THIS VAN’S A-ROCKIN’." 
HOMER 
Honey, I don’t know what you’re 
feelin’ right now. So I don’t wanna 
push anything. We can just hold 
hands... or sit and talk... 
MARGE 
(VERY AROUSED NOISE) 
She leaps on Homer, 
EXT. TRAILER 


We see Homer and Marge’s van rocking vigorously. 


IN SPRINGFIELD 


1) TOWN SQUARE 


Helen Lovejoy and Maude Flanders run a bake sale table with 
a sign reading: "Beautify Our Parks." 


CUSTOMER 
Ooh! Do you have those delicious 
marshmallow squares? 
MAUDE 
Sorry, Marge Simpson makes those. 
All the customers GROAN and walk away en masse. 
2) EXT. PARK - A LITTLE LATER 
The PARK COMMISSIONER counts the bake sale receipts. 
PARK COMMISSIONER 
Fifteen dollars short. (GRIMLY) 
Exactly what Marge Simpson’s 
marshmallow squares bring in. (TO

statue of Lincoln? 
ASSISTANT 
No, I’m afraid we’ll have to go with 
something cheaper. 
3) EXT. PARK - A LITTLE LATER 
Mayor Quimby is unveiling a statue. 
MAYOR QUIMBY 
I give you our 39th president, Jimmy 
Carter. 


He pulls off the veil. We see a statue of Jimmy Carter 
with the slogan: "MALAISE FOREVER." 



MAN #2 


He’s history’s greatest monster. 


The crowd starts rioting. They pulls the statue off its 
pedestal and start to kick it. 


4) EXT. SPRINGFIELD - LATER 


We see the crowd using Jimmy Carter’s statue as a battering 
ram to break through the window of a TV store. 


5) DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD - LATER 
We hear SIRENS and gunshots. Wiggum is standing in front 
of a police truck that has SNARLING dogs in the back, 
behind a gate. 
WIGGUM 
Release the dogs. 
Lou 
Gee, they look pretty mad. 
WIGGUM 
Yeah I’ve been starving ‘em... 
teasing ‘em... singin’ off key... 
Wiggum leans into the dogs. 
WIGGUM 


(SINGING) Me may ma moe moo. = Stow 19 


Eddie pulls the gate open. The dogs leap on Wiggum, 
attacking him. He SCREAMS. Maude Flanders looks at the 
entire sordid scene. 
MAUDE 
This never would have happened if 


Marge Simpson was here. 



EXT. PRISON - DAY cova 


Marge, wearing street clothes, walks to the gate with her 
suitcase. Homer is there.

Goodbye, Marge. 1/11 miss you.

I hope you find somebody. 
PHILLIPS 
Men are such slime. But I’m seeing 
this new guy. I think he’s 
different. 


Phillips points to the gate. We see BARNEY there, holding 
flowers. 


BARNEY 
Yoo hoo! (BELCH)

BART
No problemo. We/1l just sweep it all 
under the rug. 
FLIP TO: 

The room is now clean, but the rug has huge bulges under 
it. It pulses and GROANS. Bart tentatively walks across 
it -- each step makes a different noise. (GLASS BREAKING, a 
SQUISH, a CAT YOWL etc.) 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD - DAY 


Homer drives Marge home back through the now riotous city. 
A guillotine has been set up. Burns’ head is in it. 


BURNS 
Now, now. I know I’ve been hoarding 
meat... gas... milk... medical 
supplies... pet food... 


A billboard reads: "NEW AND IMPROVED SOYLENT GREEN -- NOW 
MADE WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE!" 


MARGE 
This town sure has changed since I’ve 
been gone. 


They pass an amphitheater labelled "SPRINGFIELD 
THUNDERDOME." A BLOODTHIRSTY CHEER goes up from the crowd. 


Homer stops at a light next to the First Church of 
Springfield. The church marquee reads: "WELCOME MONEY 


CHANGERS." ~ Seat 


A large crowd has gathered. There is a "Welcome Back 
Marge" banner on the wall. Homer’s car pulls up. The 
crowd CHEERS Marge.

for you. 
He pulls a drop cloth off of a large object next to him 
revealing that the Jimmy Carter statue has been 
reconstructed -- Marge’s bouffant hairdo has been welded 
onto the top of Jimmy’s head.
