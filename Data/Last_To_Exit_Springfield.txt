Let him earn it. 
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM 


A slightly unnerving dentist, DOCTOR WOLFE, is examining 
RALPH. 


DR. WOLFE 
How often do you brush, Ralph? 
RALPH 
Three times a day, sir. 
DR. WOLFE 
(SILKEN MENACE) Why must you turn my 
office into a house of lies? 
RALPH

enough. 
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM 


Bart is spinning a tall tale for a small group of horrified 
CHILDREN. 


BART 
Doctor Wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth 
so he can sell then. 

KID 
(SCARED) To who? 

BART 
You know that rattle when you shake up 
spray paint? That's a kid's tooth. 


The kids look scared. A NURSE who looks suspiciously

with Dr. Wolfe. 
MARGE 


How did he do, Doctor? 
DR. WOLFE 
(COLDLY) Despite horrible hygiene, 
Bart's teeth are perfect. 
Bart spits several times rapidly into the spit sink. 
BART 
(SPITS A FEW TIMES, THEN) Love that 
spit sink. 
DR. WOLFE 
(ANGRILY) It's an expectoration basin! 
(TO BART) My only hope is that one day 
I have to identify your body by those 
pretty little teeth. 
Bart cockily offers the dentist some candy. 
BART 
Jawbreaker, doc? 
DR. WOLFE

He feels inside Maggie's mouth as if she were a horse.

(POINTS) LIAR! 
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - LATER 
Dr. Wolfe examines Lisa's mouth. 
DR. WOLFE 
Uh-oh. 
LISA 
(WORRIED) What's wrong? 
DR. WOLFE 
Oh Lisa, I didn't mean to frighten you. 
Uh-oh merely means I discovered a 
problem in your mouth. 
Lisa reacts. He examines her a bit then: 
DR. WOLFE (CONT'D) 
Oh, dear God! Why her? Why herrr? 
LISA 
Why me? 
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - STUDY - LATER SCENE 5 


The Simpsons are looking at a computer screen. Maggie

I'm afraid Lisa is going to need 
braces. 
LISA 
Oh, no! I'11 be socially unpopular... 
More so. 
MARGE 
Are you sure, Doctor? 
DR. WOLFE 
Well, judge for yourself. Here's Lisa 
today... 
A pixilated version of Lisa's face appears on screen. 
DR. WOLFE (CONT'D) 
Without treatment, here's what she'll 
look like at age eleven. 


The computerized Lisa's teeth become crooked. Her overbite 
gets worse. 


DR. WOLFE (CONT'D) 
Age fourteen. 


The computerized Lisa's face now has acne, an impossible 
overbite, and jagged teeth at sharp angles to one another. 


DR. WOLFE (CONT'D) 
And finally, age eighteen. 
The computerized face is now a grotesque mass of bumps. 
There are several rows of teeth all jutting out in

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Homer is sitting on the sofa. 
ON TV 
We see two professional wrestlers, DOCTOR HILLBILLY 
and the IRON YUPPIE. The hillbilly wears overalls and a 
mortarboard; his face is garishly painted. The Iron Yuppie 
wears a suit with the sleeves ripped off, carries a 
briefcase with a skull and crossbones on it, and has an 
iron mask. A tuxedo-clad MC stands with them.

CARL (CONT'D) 
All right, all right, but seriously, we

get a free keg of beer for our 
meetings. 
ROARS its approval. 

CARL (CONT'D) 
And in exchange for that, we have to 
give up our dental plan.

PULL WIDE to Carl and CHARLIE standing behind a 
motionless Homer. Homer's butt crack is visible. Charlie 
holds a pencil up in the air directly above Homer's butt 
crack. He drops it and it lands perfectly in the butt 
crease. 
CARL 
Bullseye! (LAUGHS) 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED) Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've 
lost my train of thought. 
Homer goes back to thinking.

Lisa's braces. 
Homer jumps up on a chair. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
People stop! We can't give up our 


dental plan! 


14. 


9F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/21/92 


The members quiet down and listen. 
HOMER 
Lenny, without the dental plan, you 


wouldn't have that diamond in your 


tooth. 
Lenny smiles. We see a diamond in his tooth. Another guy 
reaches into Lenny's mouth and pulls out the diamond. 
GUY 
Yoink! 
LENNY 
Hey! 
He runs off. 
HOMER 


And Gummy Joe, where would you be 
without the dental plan? 


We see an old prospector type sitting in the crowd. He 
smiles revealing he has only one tooth. 


GUMMY JOE 
(WALTER BRENNAN TYPE VOICE) I wouldn't 
have old chomper here, that's for sure. 
HOMER 
You know what I think of this contract? 


Homer grabs the contract and starts tearing it up making 
GROWLING noises. He comes upon a page and stops. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
This!! (IMPRESSED) Hm. Now that's 
downright generous. 


He notices the crowd staring at him and resumes tearing up 
the contract and growling. The workers CHEER him on. 


15. 


9F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/21/92 


HOMER 
(CONTINUES GROWLING) I hate the whole

BURNS

SMITHERS 
Actually sir, he thwarted your campaign

his wife painted your portrait -- 
BURNS 
Doesn't ring a bell.

President of the union! I'm so proud 
of you, Homie. 
LISA 
This is your chance to get a fair shake 
for the working man. 
HOMER 
And make life-long connections to the 
world of Organized Crime. 
LISA 
Do you think you can get the dental 
plan back? 
HOMER 
Well, that depends on who's a better 
negotiator, Mr. Burns or me. 
BART 
(HOLDING DOOR STOP) Dad, I'll trade you 
this delicious door stop for your 
crummy ol' donut.

9F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/21/92 


Lisa looks worried. 
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY 


Dr. Wolfe shows Lisa and Marge an almost invisible set of 
plastic braces. 


DR. WOLFE 
Lisa and Marge, we've made remarkable 
strides in the field of braceomasty. 
These braces are invisible, painless, 
and periodically release a delightful 
burst of strawberry. 
He pushes a tiny button. The braces emit a pink mist. 
LISA 
(SNIFFS) Mmmm. 
MARGE 
(UNCOMFORTABLY) Doctor, we don't have a 
dental plan right now. So we'll need 
something a little more... affordable. 


Dr. Wolfe picks up a stryofoam head. On it is a set of 
clunky metal braces with big clumsy headgear. 


DR. WOLFE 
Now I can't tighten these too much or 
they legally become fox traps. 


He remawes them, BLOWS the dust off and holds them up to 
Lisa's face who COUGHS. 


DR. WOLFE (CONT'D) 
These predate stainless steel, so you 


can't get them wet.

Smithers. Exercising away while the 
others are off at the candy machine. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NUCLEAR PLANT - HOMER'S WORK STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Homer GRUNTS as he continues to twist his torso. We see 
that he is trying to reach a Sugar Daddy that is stuck to 
the back of his shirt. 
HOMER 
Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar 
Daddy off my back? 
Lenny enters. 
LENNY 
Okay, but it's the last time. 
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - LATER 
Homer and Burns face off across Burns' desk. 
BURNS 
We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. 
We both want a fair union contract. 
We DRIFT IN on Homer's forehead. 
HOMER'S BRAIN (V.0) 
Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me? 
BURNS 
And, if you scratch my back, I'll 


scratch yours. 


20. 


9F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/21/92 


HOMER'S BRAIN (V.0) 
Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me? 
BURNS 
I mean, if I should slip something into 
your pocket, what's the harm? 
HOMER'S BRAIN (V.0) 
Oh my God, he is coming on to me. 
BURNS 
After all, negotiations make strange 
bedfellows. (CHUCKLES, WINKS, CLICKS 
TONGUE) 
HOMER'S BRAIN (V.0O) 
Yikes! 
HOMER 
Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for 
these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm 
flattered... maybe even a little 
curious, but the answer is no. 
Homer walks decisively out the door. 
EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - HALLWAY 
BURNS (0.S.) 
I'll pay you $10,000! 


Homer stops, intrigued. Burns sticks his head out of the 
door and gives a fetching "come hither" look. 


HOMER

Homer walks off.

Lisa is in the chair. 
DR. WOLFE 
Lisa, so you won't be scared, I'll show 
you some of the tools I'll be using. 
He holds up a series of frightening-looking instruments. 
DR. WOLFE (CONT'D) 
This is the scraper. This is the 
poker. And this happy little fellow is 
the gouger. 
LISA 
(SMALL VOICE) Uh huh. 
DR. WOLFE 
Now, the first thing I'll be doing is 
chiseling some teeth out of your jaw- 
bone. Hold still while I gas you. 
LISA'S POV 


Dr. Wolfe places a mask over Lisa's face. We hear her 
BREATHING as we fade to black. 


LISA'S DREAM 
As 60'S MUSIC PLAYS, Lisa finds herself in a Peter Max- 
type setting. Four CARTOON MOP TOPS sail by in a yellow 
subnermible. 
MOP TOP #1 
Look fellas! It's Lisa in the sky. 
MOP TOP #2 


No diamonds, though. 


9F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/21/92 


MOP TOP #3 
Look out for that campy drawing of 
Queen Victoria!

Victoria. 


MOP TOPS (V.0) 
(GROANING) For the love of God, help 
us! (ETC.) 
CLOSE UP LISA'S EYES 
They SNAP open. 
In a LONG SHOT, Dr. Wolfe is twisting the last bits of wire 
onto Lisa's teeth. Lisa's back is to the camera a la the 
plastic surgeon scene in "Batman." Dr. Wolfe steps back to 
admire his work. Lisa extends an open hand. 
LISA 
The mirror. (BEAT) The mirror! 
The Doctor tentatively hands Lisa a small mirror. 


Lisa looks at herself and begins a slow LAUGH which builds 
to a crescendo. She SMASHES the mirror on the work tray. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING SCENE 2 


Homer sits on the couch, Marge and Lisa enter. Lisa is 
wearing the braces and headgear. 


MARGE

SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER runs up to greet Lisa. She grins and 
the dog runs away YELPING. Lisa trudges sadly up the 
stairs. The doorbell RINGS. 
HOMER

GOON (0.S.) 


(MUFFLED) Goons.

Homer goes to the door. 
HOMER

him off. 


EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 


The goons shove Homer into the trunk of a black four-door 
sedan and speed off. 


INT. BURNS' MANOR - AVIARY NIGHT 


Burns is in a huge room filled with birds. Next to him 
is a BIRD that looks like Burns. 


BIRD 
(BURNS-LIKE NOISE) 


The bird flies into frame and disappears like the parrot 
in "Citzen Kane." The goons bring Homer in. 


BURNS 
Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow 
didn't hurt you. 

HOMER 
You know, you could have just called 
me. 

BURNS 
Oh yes, but the telephone is so 
impersonal. I prefer the hands-on 


touch you only get with hired goons. 


24.

HOMER 
Hired goons? 


INT. BURNS! MANOR - TV ROOM 


Homer is drinking beer from a fancy mug. He and Burns look 


up at a gigantic TV screen. 
BURNS 
This is the largest TV in the free 


world. 


Burns FLICKS the TV on and a four-story high BUMBLEBEE MAN 


appears. 


ON TV 


Bumblebee Man enters BRUSHING his teeth. He pulls down the 


bed covers revealing a skunk. 
BUMBLEBEE MAN 
Aiiee! Un gato malodoro!

INT. BURNS' MANOR - LARGE ROOM - DAY 


We see many monkeys chained to typewriters. Burns

GLADIATORS FIGHTING. 


HOMER 
Wow! What are those two doing? 
BURNS. 
I haven't the foggiest. (TO GLADIATORS) 
Stop that, you two! Stop it at once. 
The embarrassed gladiators stop and exit.

All we see is black.

BURNS (V.0O) 
And this is my basement. 


Burns CLICKS on a bare light bulb. We see a small 
unfinished basement with a Ping-pong table. 


HOMER 
(LOOKING AROUND) Gee, it's not as nice 
as the other rooms. 
BURNS 
Yes, I really should stop ending the 
tour with it. 
ANGLE ON HOMER 
Drinking a beer. He looks uncomfortable. 
BACK TO SCENE 
BURNS 
Now, let's get down to business. 
HOMER'S BRAIN (V.0O) 
Oh man, I've really got to go to the 
bathroom. Why did I have all that beer 
and coffee and watermelon? 
BURNS 
Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking 
and I want to take the pressure off. 
It doesn't take a whiz to see that 
you're looking out for number one. 
Well, listen to me and you'll make a 
big splash very soon. 
HOMER 
(PAINED) Which way to the bathroom? 


27.

HOMER 
(SATISFIED NOISE) 
BURNS 
Find the bathroom alright? 
HOMER 
(LYING) Uh... yeah. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Burns' helicopter lands on the front lawn. It BLOWS 
shingles off the roof and lawn furniture bangs around.

LISA 

Come gather ‘round children/ It's high-

We can't bust heads like we used to, 
but we have our ways. 

OLD JEWISH GUY 
We tell “em we're not feelin' right and 
make “em take us to the hospital... heh 
heh. 

GRAMPA 
Another trick is to tell them stories 
that don't go anywhere... Like the 
time I caught the ferry over to 
Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for 
my shoe, so I decided to go to 
Morganville, which is what they called 
Shelbyville in those days. So I tied 
an onion to my belt, which was the 
style at the time... 


D. Burns and Smithers stand in front of the picket line, 
Burns holding a high-pressure hose.

Full power, Smithers.
